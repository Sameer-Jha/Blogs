During the Corona virus pandemic, I had a thought of journaling about my scholastic or non scholastic activities  to keep a tab on my learnings and experiences, as well as if possible share them with people who may find it useful at some point. I figured out the best way to start with this will be a blog and can further extendable to videos. Now I will be putting this idea into play, I will invest a few hours every week and post about new things I learned, experienced or found interesting and worth sharing from diverse spectrum of domains not only restricting to any particular flow. Hope will be seeing you all here.

This is my first blog post and hopefully will be improving with time.
